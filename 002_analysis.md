# Political Effects
### *by Jacqueline Beattie*


Nationalism influenced the policy implemented by states to maximize their power and self-determination.

*The Creation of Nation-States*

Nationalism in the 19th century had various political effects, shifting the structure of Europe and creating tensions among states. One of those political effects was the creation of nation-states. A nation-state is a state that has defined borders, centralized government, and shared national identity.[^1] Nationalism “justifies the building and maintenance of nation-states.”[^2] Nationalism not only made self-determination a desire, but also a necessity. 

This is exemplified by the unification of Germany, which was executed by Otto von Bismarck. Bismarck “skillfully” employed nationalism because he realized that “German nationalism would provide the moral issue with which to justify a war against Austria.”[^3] A united Germany could only be achieved by joining the largest German state, Prussia, with a moral goal of national unity. Nationalism enabled Bismarck to declare “just” wars and unite all German people under a single goal, ultimately leading to the creation of a singular German state. Bismarck’s use of nationalism and his success in unification exemplify nationalism’s capability to contribute to the creation of nation-states. Additionally, German unification was something European states feared for a long time and consequently transformed the geo-political structure of Europe.

Italy underwent a similar transformation as Italian nationalists and liberals sought to end foreign domination. Guiseppe Mazzini, a Republican Nationalist, attempted various insurrections to unify Italy in the 1850s. While ultimately Mazzini’s revolts were unsuccessful, the revolts laid the foundations and groundwork for future unification. Following through with the nationalist movement, the Kingdom of Sardinia assumed leadership and “proceeded to expand its boundaries until it had acquired virtually all the entire Italian peninsula,” resulting in a new regime.[^4] The new Kingdom of Italy was a highly centralized state and eliminated regional autonomy.[^5] The nationalist desire for unification and an independent and strong Italy led to its eventual creation as a nation-state, just as it did for Germany.

Nationalism justified the desire for and creation of nation-states, rationalizing the means used to gain self-determination. The unification of Germany and Italy would change the geopolitical structure of Europe, and their consolidation of national power is seen as a rising tension leading to the First World War.

*Imperialism*

Another political effect of nationalism is imperialism and empire-building. With nationalism, there was an increase in pride in one’s country and a desire to be the most powerful. One way power was measured was by the size of a nation’s empire and its imperial holdings. At the end of the 19th century, European nations scrambled to conquer and expand their authority, as seen in the scramble for Africa. 

Nationalism encouraged imperialism by making imperial holdings a factor of security. Clemenceau, the French Prime Minister, worried about the future of the French nation and embraced imperialism because he “hoped that colonial manpower would protect French citizens against aggression.”[^6] There was an implementation of imperialism for the sake of national sovereignty; it was in the national interest and desperation to expand. 

Britain similarly strived to promote their interests and increase its influence over Africa. Depicted in *The Rhodes Colossus*, Cecil Rhodes, a British Business magnate, stands over the continent of Africa holding a telegraph line.[^7] He planned to build a railway and telegraph line from Cape Town to Cairo, to connect the British colonies. This recognizable political cartoon is a pun on the Colossus of Rhodes. It alludes to the Scramble for Africa, conveying how European powers sought to expand their colonial power in Africa. Rhodes was a nationalist who sought British expansion to maintain its standing. Nationalism was the motivation behind Britain’s expansion and need to increase national strength, to be the most powerful. 

Moreover, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany was a strong nationalist who promoted aggressive expansion and German pride through his policy of “Weltpolitik.” Nationalist sentiments inspired his goals of making Germany a world power. His famous quote, “We have fought for our place in the sun and have won it,” evokes this desire to be a hegemon. With his policies, military and colonial power were equated with national power.

Nationalism influenced foreign policy by suggesting that imperialism was a necessary tool for being a European power, leading to competition for imperial holdings. Subsequently, this “scramble” for colonies increased tensions and rivalries between the European powers that culminated in the years before the First World War.

*Disintegration of Multi-Ethnic Empires/Revolts*

Similar to the influence behind the creation of nation-states, nationalism caused turmoil and disintegration of large multi-ethnic empires. Empires such as the Austrian Empire and the Ottoman Empire were composed of various ethnic groups, which already caused tensions. However, the desire for self-determination and nationalist movements in these empires led to revolt and disintegration.

The Austrian Empire was composed of many different ethnicities and very little of it was actually German, which caused long-lasting tensions. Eventually, increasing nationalist movements made it impossible for no change to occur. The transition of the Austrian Empire to the Austro-Hungarian Empire is a prime example. The Hungarians revolted in 1848 and ultimately lost, but eventually gained autonomy in 1866.[^8] However, tensions only escalated for the various other ethnicities who received no gains, creating an atmosphere of conflict. A Hungarian nation-state “provoked nationalist counter-claims in the name of Romanian, Serbian, Croatian, Slovak, and Transylvanian Saxon nations.”[^9] The nationalist movements of various ethnicities caused internal conflicts that created disunity, and eventually the dissolution of multi-ethnic empires. 

The Ottoman Empire, often referred to as "the sick man of Europe," had waning power. With the addition of a pan-Slavic movement in the Balkans and Balkan nationalism, we saw exacerbating conditions. Russia, the largest Slavic nation, was thought to have a “historical duty to liberate the rest of the Balkans people.”[^10] Conflict between Russia, the Ottomans, and Austria, arose from questions about who should control the Balkans. The nationalist desire for Pan-Slavism, and nationalist interests in Russia, contributed to competition among these powers which played out in the First World War, and ultimately led to the disintegration of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires. 

Nationalism created national fervor that sparked revolts and revolutions for independence in multi-ethnic empires, creating tensions among different ethnic groups that were seen worsening before World War I as well.

# Social Impacts
### *by Samantha Baldwin*

*Education*

Nationalist ideology in 19th-century Europe coincided with the concept of a nation-state as the overlap between the political and cultural features that make a territory unified and whole. Education systems throughout Europe conformed to the belief that nation-states must share a common language, culture, and history. Some countries promoted mass education of national history and civic values in hopes that it would instill a sense of pride and belonging in citizens. For example, Prussia’s education system underwent a major evolution towards nationalist teachings after nationalists such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte called for reform, believing that educating students on nationalist beliefs would encourage their loyalty to a unified German nation state.

One of the most influential German nationalist documents of the century was Fichte’s Addresses to the German Nation: a piece of literature which he wrote during the aftermath of German occupation by Napoleonic France. Fichte spent a large portion of his addresses outlining and defending an education system that would instill nationalist beliefs in German youths. He proposed a school curriculum that reflected ideals of German identity, culture, and patriotism, while also cultivating personal virtue and moral character to encourage students to think for themselves. Fichte’s writings reflect the mindset that willingness to surrender oneself to their community and nation-state must be given by an individual rather than demanded by those in power[^11]. This shift from oppression under Napoleon to voluntary social responsibility to Germany sought to intellectually bind students to their nation-state and each other.

Additionally, both Prussia and Italy promoted their respective national languages of German and Italian through schooling, most notably in areas where an alternate dialect was spoken.[^12] While nationalism in education began as an optimistic shift towards national unity, over time, it came at the cost of stifling diversity and forcing assimilation on ethnic and cultural minorities.

*Discrimination*

Increased nationalism in the education system was not beneficial to all of a nation’s citizens, as this philosophy led to the intense pressure towards minorities to conform. This is evident through Prussia’s treatment of its Polish territories. Karl von Altenstein, who served as Prussia’s Minister of Education from 1817-1840, saw no issue with allowing Polish students to learn primarily in their mother tongue. However, following his death, the Prussian government increased pressure on these territories to conform to German language and ideals.[^13] Similar changes occurred during the Risorgimento, the Italian movement toward unification, when the Tuscan dialect became the standard language in schools across Italy. While Italian nationalists such as politician Giuseppe Mazzini championed major educational reforms to unify citizens, these efforts reinforced the idea that Southern dialects and cultures were inferior, to the extent where racism against southerners still permeates the social dynamics of Italy today.[^14]

Nationalism-driven discrimination intensified throughout the century, particularly through the rise of social darwinism. This ideology, which argued that only the strongest or most fit groups could thrive in society, was used to justify extreme nationalism by promoting the idea of the inherent superiority of a dominant race. As national identity became increasingly tied to ethnic uniformity, anti-Semitic sentiment grew across Europe— this time, more centered around Jews as an ethnic race rather than a religion. Many believed that Jewish people were outsiders who plotted to overthrow the structure of society through influencing politics, media, and economics.[^15] 

These beliefs were reflected in France during the Dreyfus Affair, in which Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish artillery officer, was wrongfully convicted of high treason for revealing French military secrets to Germany. This is just one case of how nationalist movements frequently scapegoated vulnerable minority groups to assert power over those they deemed obstacles to national unity. This event also highlighted the socioeconomic repercussions of discrimination within communities. A recent analysis of the French stock market throughout the controversy found that firms with Jewish board members lost value during the Dreyfus Affair.[^16] While some of these companies saw improved performance after Dreyfus was proven innocent, many investors were still hesitant, making recovery slow and arduous. Despite the accusations against Dreyfus being proven unfounded, the antisemitic beliefs they ignited persisted and would only escalate in years to come.

*Collectivism vs. Individualism*

In the early 19th-century, the Enlightenment brought on a wave of Romanticism and focus on individuality, spirituality, celebration of nature, and the human experience.[^17] Followers of this movement often rejected assimilation into modern society in favor of connecting with their inner selves and exercising free thought. However, the Napoleonic Era soon swept across Europe, increasing chaos and revolutionary instability. Following the restoration and official end of this era, many began to shift their beliefs towards Conservatism, valuing stability and collective identity over the individual empowerment of the Revolution.[^18]
Social welfare programs throughout Germany improved social cohesion and loyalty from citizens, particularly the working class. Otto von Bismarck’s national health and accident insurance programs promoted nationalism by aiding the health of children who could one day become effective soldiers, workers, and overall citizens.[^19] These policies fostered unity and collectivism among Germans and served as a reminder of their roles in a broader nation that required their contribution.

In all cases of developing nationalism throughout 19th-century Europe, movements required individuals to place value in collective identity over personal identity, whether that meant altering education systems, stifling cultural practices, or discriminating against those who did not fit the perceived national ideal. This demonstrates a significant departure from early Enlightenment ideals. Through cultural, economic, and political changes, the overarching message was clear: social assimilation was a unifier, and the success of one’s nation depended on their willingness to sacrifice their own ambitions and identities for the national cause.

*National Identities*

With the introduction of nationalism came the creation of national identities. Before, people identified with their regional identities. More loyalty lay with the regional area where a person lived than the country they were from. This point of loyalty remained through nationalism, with national identity being added alongside regional identities. The introduction of national identities can be seen in the aftermath of the French Revolution. Following the revolution, many members of the Third Estate were able to join the army, something which previously could only be done by the nobility. They were also conscripted to join, fueling Napoleon’s campaign to extend throughout Europe. The Third Estate joined the army and fought for the country, which they had a hand in “creating” by overthrowing the old monarchy. Initially, this nationalism started as pride in themselves, and then extended to the nation as something they built; an extension of the people.

Napoleon also granted rights that the Third Estate fought for during the French Revolution, while stirring nationalistic patriotism. He introduced the tricolor flag (1) as the national flag, which was previously a symbol of the revolution, introduced a national anthem, and gave patriotic speeches. (2)[^20] Napoleon was the personification of revolutionary and nationalist principles. He generally created better living conditions, outlining a clear set of laws in the Napoleonic Code, and abolished serfdom. (3)[^21]
 
A similar instance can be seen after the unification of Germany. The German territories were fragmented, and following the French Revolution many residents were emboldened to campaign for unification. Several revolts occurred, including participation in the Revolutions of 1831, until the area was officially unified in 1871. Similarly to the French Revolution, the tricolor flag, which was seen as a symbol of the unification efforts, became the national flag. This spurred nationalism, as it was a country that the people had been fighting to make into a reality. 

In France, there was also an effort to standardize their language. There were many regional dialects, which exemplified regional identities. Standard French became the national language and a symbol of unity within the nation, being further implemented in schools. This policy was furthered in the 1880s, by the Third Republic. The regime established compulsory education, which declared French should be spoken at all times while at the school.  (4)[^22]

*Unified Identities*

With nationalism came a sense of a strong unified national identity, as created by the state. These unified identities were then placed in the context of pre-existing tensions among ethnic and religious lines. As seen in The Butcher’s Tale,  (5)[^23] the citizens of the town came together to create a strong, unified force. But they did so against the Jewish community of the town. As nationalism created a unified identity, any friction from people outside the identity was treated to strong opposition. The situation builds into an “us versus them” scenario. Therefore, this unification was actually a unification by promoting a common enemy in exchange for a national identity. It is unification by division against the already marginalized and ostracized groups in a town, the reason for disliking them just changes to a nationalistic cause. 

This also feeds into scientific racism and ideas of social darwinism. There were many different attempts to distinguish people and races by the size of their head (phrenology), which were then interpreted into meaning that certain people or races were better than others, creating a social hierarchy based in pseudo-science.  (6)[^24]

*Romantic Nationalism*

Romantic Nationalism is seen through art and national symbols. For example, the painting *Chasseur in the Forest* embodies German nationalism: a Frenchman isolated and surrounded by trees, which represent the Germany army. This painting was meant to show the Napoleonic expansion across Europe, and the might of the German army, which overwhelms the lone French soldier. It was painted after the Germans were successful in pushing out the French forces. Winning wars brings a strong sense of nationalism, as there is a sense of pride for those that had served in the army, or those who know people in the army. The act of going to war in defense of the country in itself is based in nationalism.

This type of nationalism was also seen during the German unification, when people would show their support for the unification of the German states through a tricolor flag, which then became the flag of the nation. This symbol helps inspire nationalism by reminding them that it was their victory, as a people. There was also the introduction of national anthems, singing songs in support of and praising the nation. These have been seen in the beginning of any large event, such as sports competitions, which also promote nationalism.

During the French Revolution, the revolting citizens used the tricolor flag to show their support. Before this, the royal government used complex flags with the coat of arms of the current ruler. The tricolor flag was simple, and stood for revolution and opposition against the royals. After Napoleon took power, he made the tricolor flag into the national flag. This symbol helped to inspire nationalism by reminding the citizens that it was their victory, as a people. It also created a positive association with the regime, because the flag embodied the ideals that they fought for. 

There was also the introduction of national anthems, singing songs in support of and praising the nation. The French national anthem, *La Marseillaise* was the call to revolution during the French Revolution. It highlights ideas of fighting against tyranny and protecting the nation. It inspired a lot of patriotism from those that listen to it, commanding the listeners to rise up and fight for their country.
