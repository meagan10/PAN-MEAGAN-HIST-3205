*National Identities*

With the introduction of nationalism came the creation of national identities. Before, people identified with their regional identities. More loyalty lay with the regional area where a person lived than the country they were from. This point of loyalty remained through nationalism, with national identity being added alongside regional identities. The introduction of national identities can be seen in the aftermath of the French Revolution. Following the revolution, many members of the Third Estate were able to join the army, something which previously could only be done by the nobility. They were also conscripted to join, fueling Napoleon’s campaign to extend throughout Europe. The Third Estate joined the army and fought for the country, which they had a hand in “creating” by overthrowing the old monarchy. Initially, this nationalism started as pride in themselves, and then extended to the nation as something they built; an extension of the people.

Napoleon also granted rights that the Third Estate fought for during the French Revolution, while stirring nationalistic patriotism. He introduced the tricolor flag as the national flag, which was previously a symbol of the revolution, introduced a national anthem, and gave patriotic speeches. (1) Napoleon was the personification of revolutionary and nationalist principles. He generally created better living conditions, outlining a clear set of laws in the Napoleonic Code, and abolished serfdom.
 
A similar instance can be seen after the unification of Germany. The German territories were fragmented, and following the French Revolution many residents were emboldened to campaign for unification. Several revolts occurred, including participation in the Revolutions of 1831, until the area was officially unified in 1871. Similarly to the French Revolution, the tricolor flag, which was seen as a symbol of the unification efforts, became the national flag. This spurred nationalism, as it was a country that the people had been fighting to make into a reality. 

In France, there was also an effort to standardize their language. There were many regional dialects, which exemplified regional identities. Standard French became the national language and a symbol of unity within the nation, being further implemented in schools. This policy was furthered in the 1880s, by the Third Republic. The regime established compulsory education, which declared French should be spoken at all times while at the school. (2)

*Unified Identities*

With nationalism came a sense of a strong unified national identity, as created by the state. These unified identities were then placed in the context of pre-existing tensions among ethnic and religious lines. As seen in The Butcher’s Tale, (3) the citizens of the town came together to create a strong, unified force. But they did so against the Jewish community of the town. As nationalism created a unified identity, any friction from people outside the identity was treated to strong opposition. The situation builds into an “us versus them” scenario. Therefore, this unification was actually a unification by promoting a common enemy in exchange for a national identity. It is unification by division against the already marginalized and ostracized groups in a town, the reason for disliking them just changes to a nationalistic cause. 

This also feeds into scientific racism and ideas of social darwinism. There were many different attempts to distinguish people and races by the size of their head (phrenology), which were then interpreted into meaning that certain people or races were better than others, creating a social hierarchy based in pseudo-science. 

*Romantic Nationalism*

Romantic Nationalism is seen through art and national symbols. For example, the painting *Chasseur in the Forest* embodies German nationalism: a Frenchman isolated and surrounded by trees, which represent the Germany army. This painting was meant to show the Napoleonic expansion across Europe, and the might of the German army, which overwhelms the lone French soldier. It was painted after the Germans were successful in pushing out the French forces. Winning wars brings a strong sense of nationalism, as there is a sense of pride for those that had served in the army, or those who know people in the army. The act of going to war in defense of the country in itself is based in nationalism.

This type of nationalism was also seen during the German unification, when people would show their support for the unification of the German states through a tricolor flag, which then became the flag of the nation. This symbol helps inspire nationalism by reminding them that it was their victory, as a people. There was also the introduction of national anthems, singing songs in support of and praising the nation. These have been seen in the beginning of any large event, such as sports competitions, which also promote nationalism.
  
During the French Revolution, the revolting citizens used the tricolor flag to show their support. Before this, the royal government used complex flags with the coat of arms of the current ruler. The tricolor flag was simple, and stood for revolution and opposition against the royals. After Napoleon took power, he made the tricolor flag into the national flag. This symbol helped to inspire nationalism by reminding the citizens that it was their victory, as a people. It also created a positive association with the regime, because the flag embodied the ideals that they fought for. 

There was also the introduction of national anthems, singing songs in support of and praising the nation. The French national anthem, *La Marseillaise* was the call to revolution during the French Revolution. It highlights ideas of fighting against tyranny and protecting the nation. It inspired a lot of patriotism from those that listen to it, commanding the listeners to rise up and fight for their country.
