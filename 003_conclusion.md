# Conclusion
### *by Lana Youngs*

In conclusion, nationalism was a defining force in shaping the political, social, and cultural landscape of nineteenth-century Europe, with its effects still influencing the global society today. Politically, nationalism was the driving force behind the creation of unified nation-states, as seen in Germany under the rule of Otto von Bismarck, completely changing the geopolitics of the region, and laying the foundation for tensions between these newly crowned nation-states leading to World War 1. Socially, nationalism simultaneously united and divided through promoting loyalty to one’s nation while consequently encouraging discrimination against ethnic minority groups, such as the anti-semitism and ethnic superiority over the Jewish people in Germany. The rise of nationalism also held up collective identities over individual ones, as seen through political decisions and the growing idea of Social Darwinism. Culturally, nationalism transformed local identities into unified national ones through symbols within media such as flags and anthems, while simultaneously fueling xenophobia, as seen with the intense discrimination of the Jews in Konitz in the Butcher’s Tale. All throughout Europe, nationalism fostered a unity and pride in one’s nation, but also created further divisions between ethnic groups, which would open the door to future intercontinental and even global conflicts. Its pervasive influence altered political ideologies, deepened cultural transformations, and continues to shape modern societal structures, often sparking debates about inclusion and identity. This duality highlights the enduring complexity of nationalism as both a unifying and divisive force in human history. Overall, nationalism fundamentally changed Europe’s sense of identity and political order, leaving a lasting effect that would influence the continent for the years to come.
