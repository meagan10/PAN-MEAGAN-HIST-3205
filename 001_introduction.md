### *by Meagan Pan*

Nationality is now one of the primary ways that people identify themselves. Along with this, the current geopolitical landscape is structured around ‘the nation’ as the arbiter of sovereignty—but this is a relatively new phenomenon. Nationalism and the concept of the nation-state first came into prominence in the nineteenth century. Nationalism originated from the French Revolution and then spread throughout Europe in the Napoleonic Era as Napoleon defeated and occupied lands in Western and Central Europe. Movements for liberation from French control gained a national character and contributed to national awakening for these peoples.[^1]

Initially, nationalism had ties to romanticism and liberalism and mainly attracted intellectuals, but over time it became more broadly influential and integrated into other movements.[^2] After the liberal nationalist revolutions failed in 1848, nationalism did not fade away with them. It was the driving force for the eventual successful unifications of Germany and Italy, and fueled imperialism as national prestige became a major reason to acquire colonies and expand empires. 

The impact of nationalism also spread beyond the geopolitical stage, influencing culture and society in European states. National education systems were created to develop this concept of a national identity among the people, encapsulated in the quote from the Italian statesman Massimo d’Azeglio: “We have made Italy, now we must make Italians.”[^3] Over the course of the century, the focal point of nationalism shifted away from pure liberation and took on a more belligerent form as it called for increasing a nation’s military power and influence to compete with or overtake other nations.[^4] Due to this, one of the biggest transformative effects of nationalism in nineteenth-century Europe was its impact on Europe’s geopolitical structure and its setting up of tensions between states and peoples that escalated leading up to the First World War.
